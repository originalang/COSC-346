        <h1>What's up with Django?</h1>
        A review of the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web framework <br><br>

        <h2>What is Django?</h2>
        <kbd style="font-size: 1.2rem;">[ From the Django project website ]</kbd>
        <p>
            Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
            Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on
            writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.
        </p>

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>
            Django seemingly shifts focus from the tedious process of web development and grants the developer the
            ability to concentrate on the application that is being built. Web apps can be conceptualized and executed
            in a short timeframe with a variety of pre-built functionality. I especially like that Django manages user
            authentication, and that the created app is easily scalable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Django is based on <code>Python</code>, which means that the backend code is written in an
            <kbd>easy-to-follow</kbd> language that is readable and accessible. This makes it possible for developers at
            various levels to create and publish <mark>dynamic</mark> web content by using a combination of HTML
            templates and Python classes in projects. Interaction with databases is also made very easy through this
            framework. The use of HTML templates is a great feature because of the ease with which variables and
            functions can be incorporated within HTML files. The best part about Django is, perhaps, the
            <code>manage.py</code> script that enables interaction with the app through the command line. Developers can
            start a local development server, collect all static assets into a single forlder, migrate database
            structures, and so on.

        <h2>What is GraphQL?</h2>

        <p>
            GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
            GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power
            to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables
            powerful developer tools.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This discussion set out answer a set of key questions related to the emergence and current trajectory of
            GraphQL. Most individuals dis not expect
            GraphQL to gain the popularity that it did, to the point where it is growing fast that companies have begun
            using it in production. GraphQL was <kbd>open-sourced</kbd> by Facebook, and
            a lot of people are only recently starting to explore it. This has led to a bimodal distibution, where one
            group of users is extremely experienced with the system,
            while the other group of users is working on understanding its intricacies. It is especially important to
            close this gap between the two groups because
            GraphQL solves a fundamental problem that exists between the backend and frontend teams - the backend team
            controlling the API.
        </p>
        <p>
            GraphQL represents a very smart abstraction that embodies good arcitectural concepts that were lost along
            the way. An observation was made that
            the REST API mechanism today is very weird. The system of <kbd>client - server</kbd> communication is broken
            because the server has no idea where
            the client lives, and the client has no idea what information will be sent back. This seems like a strange
            standard to base all REST communication on.
            In light of this, GraphQL is predicted to stick around for while, and not be passed up like any other fad.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the recommendation for a beginner is to start by doing, and not worry about setting things up as
            the documentation suggests. GraphQL is supposedly intuitive and simple to follow for a beginner, so it makes
            it easier for developers to understand how and why it works.

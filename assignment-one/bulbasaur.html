        Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the
        seed grows progressively larger.

        <h1>Bulbasaur</h1>
        <p><bdi>Bulbasaur</bdi> is a small, quadruped Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red
            eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a
            wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its
            thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On its back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed
            planted there at birth. The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the
            nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
        </p>
        <p>
            <bdo>As mentioned in the anime</bdo>, starter Pokémon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new
            Trainers. Having
            been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. It is known to
            be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur has also shown itself to be an excellent
            caretaker, even having a special technique called the "Bulba-by." To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses
            its vines to pick up a young Pokémon and soothingly rocks it in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
            <cite>It is found in grasslands and forests</cite> throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as
            starter Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It
            has been observed that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to
            evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in
            Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.
